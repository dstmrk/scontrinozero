# Runs the hook with synthetic Bash tool invocations and asserts the
# expected exit code (2 = block, 0 = pass). Run from repo root:
#   ./.claude/hooks/test-block-push-to-main.sh
#
# This is a defense-in-depth net for CLAUDE.md regola 1: a regex that
# fails to block `develop:main`, `:main`, `+main`, force-push refspec
# or `refs/heads/main` would defeat the whole purpose of the hook.
